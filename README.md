## üîß Core Hardware Components

### 1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)
Often referred to as the **brain of the computer**, is responsible for executing instructions from a program. It performs basic arithmetic, logic, control, and I/O operations specified by the instructions.

**Examples:** Intel Core i7, AMD Ryzen 7, etc.

### 2. Core
Individual processing unit within a CPU. Modern CPUs can have multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

**Example:** A quad core processor has 4 cores, allowing it to perform 4 tasks simultaneously. For instance, one core could handle your web browser, another your music player, another a download manager, and another a background system update.

## üíæ Software Execution Units

### 3. Program
A set of instructions written in a programming language that tells the computer how to perform a specific task.

**Example:** Microsoft Word is a program that allows users to create and edit documents.

### 4. Process
Instance of a program that is being executed. When a program runs, the OS creates a process to manage its execution.

**Example:** When we open Microsoft Word, it becomes a process in the OS.

### 5. Thread
Smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads, which share the same resources but can run independently.

**Example:** A web browser like Google Chrome might use multiple threads for different tabs, with each tab running as a separate thread.

## ‚ö° Parallel Processing Concepts

### 6. Multitasking
Allows OS to run multiple processes simultaneously.

- **Single-core CPUs:** This is done through time-sharing, rapidly switching between tasks
- **Multi-core CPUs:** True parallel execution occurs, with tasks distributed across cores
- The OS scheduler balances the load, ensuring efficient and responsive system performance

**Example:** We are browsing the internet while listening to music and downloading a file.

> üí° **Note:** Multitasking utilizes the capabilities of a CPU and its cores. When an OS performs multitasking, it can assign different tasks to different cores. This is more efficient than assigning all tasks to a single core.

### 7. Multithreading
Ability to execute multiple threads within a single process concurrently.

**Example:** A web browser can use multithreading by having separate threads for rendering the page, running JS, and managing user inputs. This makes the browser more responsive and efficient.

**How it works:**
- **Single core system:** Both threads and processes are managed by the OS scheduler through time slicing and context switching to create the illusion of simultaneous execution
- **Multi core system:** Both threads and processes can run in true parallel on different cores, with the OS scheduler distributing tasks across the cores to optimize performance

> üí° **Enhancement:** Multithreading enhances the efficiency of multitasking by breaking down individual tasks into smaller sub-tasks or threads. These threads can be processed simultaneously, making better use of CPU capabilities.

## üïê OS Scheduling Mechanisms

### 8. Time Slicing
- **Definition:** Divides CPU time into smaller intervals called time slices or quanta
- **Function:** The OS scheduler allocates these time slices to different processes or threads, ensuring each gets a fair share of CPU time
- **Purpose:** This prevents any single process or thread from monopolizing the CPU, improving responsiveness and enabling concurrent execution

### 9. Context Switching
- **Definition:** Process of saving the state of a currently running process or thread and loading the state of the next one to be executed
- **Function:** When a process or thread's time slice expires, the OS scheduler performs a context switch to move the CPU's focus to another process or thread
- **Purpose:** This allows multiple processes and threads to share the CPU, giving the appearance of simultaneous execution on a single-core CPU or improving parallelism on multi-core CPUs

## üîÑ Key Comparisons

### Multitasking vs Multithreading

| Aspect | Multitasking | Multithreading |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Relationship** | Can be achieved through multithreading where each task is divided into threads that are managed concurrently | More granular, dealing with multiple threads within the same process or application |
| **Operation Level** | Operates at the level of processes, which are the OS's primary units of execution | Operates at the level of threads, which are smaller units within a process |
| **Resource Management** | Involves managing resources between completely separate programs, which may have independent memory spaces and system resources | Involves managing resources within a single program, where threads share the same memory and resources |
| **Benefits** | Allows us to run multiple applications simultaneously, improving productivity and system utilization | Allows a single application to perform multiple tasks at the same time, improving application performance and responsiveness |

## üìù Summary

- **Multitasking** typically refers to the running of multiple applications
- **Multithreading** is more granular, dealing with multiple threads within the same process or application
- Both concepts work together to maximize system efficiency and user experience
